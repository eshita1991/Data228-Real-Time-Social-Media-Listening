The comfort issues with vr headsets are very well known, and they would have known about the lack of software applications better than anyone.\n\nSo, they have a very expensive headset that is uncomfortable to wear for long periods and very little people can do with it.

You're very closed off and in your own isolated space when using it and you can't share the experience with others around you.  Great for people who live or work alone, but very awkward for people who need to be aware of those around them.  I think that's why Apple put the facial gestures and the eye camera pass through on the Vision pro, to make the people more present with their surroundings.  But that doesn't solve the problem.\n\nI think Vision Pro would be great for education and classrooms.  Great for artists and doctors and engineers.  Anyone who needs to work with objects in a 3D space.  But the average person sitting on their couch or on the bus or walking around downtown has no need for it.  We have our pocket phones and TV's already."

I always disliked 3D because it made the picture darker and I already wear glasses. But the 3D with the AVP is amazing and makes me enjoy the format. \n\nThe thing is a couple months old and developers barely got their hands on it. Why would people be flocking to it to begin with? Apple could barely get Sony to make 900k micro oled screens. So this headset is already limited to around 400k its first year. \n\nBut people make it sound like there are millions of unsold models sitting on the shelves, cementing it flopped? That math doesn\u2019t add up. \n\nOf course there isn\u2019t a killer app, the developers have barely started developing for it. If a new product isn\u2019t immediately supported by every person it\u2019s all of a sudden a Failure?\n\nI for one enjoy watching this tech evolve, but it\u2019s not gonna catch on over night obviously.

Make every political dollar donated public. Pay politicians 1 million a year with honesty clause. Why not a space camp for the environment called earth camp to inspire young geo engineers and ecologists to figure how to cool the earth and renew the soil. Kids put in two years in NOAA they get college free. Train kids on Linux and open source. So many worthwhile things can be done, but there is no vision. We need to leverage every heart and soul on the planet to get in the game. In a world like that Vision Pro might have a real chance at being useful. We need a jobs program to fix problems. Money, status and celebrity culture are abstractions that are killing us. We are never going to survive if we don\u2019t realize we are one. Utopia or Destruction?"

Sure the technology is very impressive; but what can you actually do with it? Not having any gaming support at all; despite Apple's big push to gain relevance in that segment on the Mac, is a huge swing-and-a-miss on their part. At this point, I don't think even a non-Pro model at \\~half the price would even resuscitate the interest; because there's still nothing that can really be done with it that doesn't fall into the \"party trick\" category."

                "text": "Like the Watch, Apple doesn't have a clear compelling use case for the VP on launch.  They take the if you build it, theyll come attitude. They figured they would put the hardware and platform out there and let devs figure out what to do with it and let it grow organically\n\nThis approach worked for the watch. But that's because lots of people want a fitness tracker anyway and here's a fancy one that integrates nicely with your iPhone and lets you take calls and read messages in a pinch. Also very handy for pinging your iPhone. The Watch is pretty damn successful though it's not much talked about.\n\nIt's not working out for the VP, because for one thing it costs 3500$. Nobody NEEDS this thing. Apple could've targeted professionals e.g. medicine or engineering but they wanted consumers instead. They could've targeted gamers but they didn't probably b/c other companies are doing it already. It's a general consumer device that's too expensive with no killer app on launch. Because it's too expensive with too few users, devs have a hard time justifying even buying one to explore it, much less spending more resources to develop for it. Developing for iOS devices is already a pita. This has to be pita to 11.\n\nIf Apple wants this to succeed, THEY have to put in the work and develop stuff for it. THEY have to put in more money to create content like immersive sports to show how cool this stuff is. A few demos in the app store won't cut it. They need to put out fresh content like every month at least. They have to show they're all in on this themselves if they want other people to buy in"
