There are a few niche interests that are hugely aided by membership in subreddits. But what I do now? Where I spend a ton of time just hanging out and commenting and reading stuff? No freaking way.\n\nAnd then on the other hand if a lot of people have a similar reaction to me then how good are these subreddits going to be? I mean I'm not going to camp them answering questions myself. Maybe other people won't either. Or maybe only people like content creators who are trying to market their YouTube channel or whatever, Instagram, whatever pays their bills. Maybe they'll use it.\n\nBut I'm basically pretty much done with this website if I can't use RIF or something as good.\n\nHave you ever tried commenting and having a conversation on YouTube? No wonder the comments section there sucks: it's an enormous pain in the ass. I mean I'm not going to run down the features but it's not worth my time. Sometimes I'll say one thing to try to get engagement numbers up for a YouTuber I like; I consider that a little bit like leaving a small tip. But I don't realistically think that I'm going to have a conversation there, or on Imgur either.\n\nNo, there's no substitute for the way this site currently works that I'm aware of, and if they ruin it like this maybe I'll just read more books."

Tired of these anti-user policies, you aren't going to get what you want out of this, you aren't going to usher in some new era of user driven content.

It's really more of a pattern of changes designed to create and empower a nationwide corporate oligarchy of hyper loyal media companies capable of restricting information access on as many platforms as possible for as many people as possible. It's very Putin-esque: blurring the line between business and government with a focus on loyalty, control over individuals, and wealth centralization. "

The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.\nHowever there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!\nIt sounds great but;\n1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!\n2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.\n3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.\n\nNet neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.\n \nSo yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers. So beware and make sure every not-tech-savvy person is informed on the risk!"

Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless. For many years, Chairman Pai has called on the FCC to update its media ownership regulations\u2014one of which dates back to 1975. The Chairman is sticking to his long-held views, and given the strong case for modernizing these rules, it's not surprising that those who disagree with him would prefer to do whatever they can to distract from the merits of his proposals."

Millions still falsely believe in the main piece of russian fake news propagated by the kremlin/wikileaks/trump. \"the dem primary was rigged in favor of hillary\" That is an outright lie and it did not happen. She won by 3.7 million which is a massive margin. Hillary and obama were much closer in 2008. This is a massive lie that people still believe.

Over the past 20 years, the Internet has evolved and grown, partially because of the absence of government involvement. Overregulation can hurt an industry by stifling investment and limiting  competition, thereby hurting the consumer. Where there is less burdensome regulation, innovation thrives. It is difficult to overstate the importance of the Internet to peoples' daily lives, and it is essential to the operations of a variety of industries. The federal government should promote access for as many consumers at the highest level of bandwidth possible, not stifle the industry through excessive regulations. \""

This is far more nefarious, completely shits down any level of protest or organization short of meeting in person.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that having tiered service lanes would be alright, not even close. But they idea that ISPs would work in collusion to completely censure information or discussion which opposes their agendas is far worse. Given our reliance on the internet to communicate, and that classic media is already under a fairly strong grip of the few companies that control them, this would be the last nail in the coffin for killing any semblance of a free society. \n\nYet not a peep is mentioned about this in all the discussions about NN. How? Why? I think the profit argument is just a massive bait to ignore this attack on our most basic freedoms, and it\u2019s scary how damn well it\u2019s working \n\n"

            "text": "I feel like a key problem with rallying for net neutrality is the sheer amount of people that don't understand what it is or how it works. \n\nIt also doesn't help that the media doesn't care too much about presenting it (as television corporations are typically against it). \n\nI think net neutrality, or rather the repeal of net neutrality needs rebranding. \n\nIn order for people to care, they need to realize what repealing net neutrality actually does. If we start referring to those who do not support net neutrality as people that are anti-Netflix, or anti-YouTube, and can make one of those the coloquial term, the general populace may start to care. \n\nIt needs to be taken a step further though, the American people need to realize that taking away net neutrality is in fact a method of limiting free speech. It could be called \"anti-Netflix\" legislation or \"pay-per-speak\" legislation. \n\nPeople need to be aware that this is not a matter of politics. Whether they identify as a democrat, republican, or any number of the minority parties, this is something that can be used to limit free speech.\n\nSteps to help:\n\n1. Learn the analogy of roads to explain net neutrality\n\n2. Explain the corporate motivation for ending net neutrality\n\n3. Refer to it as \"anti-Netflix\" or \"pay-per-speak\" legislation\n\n4. Explain that you believe Internet access is the same as any utility, and not a luxury service\n\nOrganization and awareness are the only way we can say net neutrality. If we can form a movement that defines net neutrality and promotes it, we may just be able to save it once more. "

The internet is the freest possible form of expression. limiting someone's access to legal content, news, media, etc. is the definition of hindering free speech and expression   \n\n\n\nEdit: I have submitted a formal written request to the ACLU requesting representation for filing such a suit and have reached out to several lawyers in my area. I will be calling the ACLU legal help line tomorrow as well. They closed before I had a chance to call today. \n\n\nEdit-2: there have been several comments about the lack of legal standing for such a Lawsuit. Everyone is welcome to their opinion, but I disagree with these opinions. And there is point of fact enough standing in the argument the Texas V. Johnson sets the precedent for freedom expression is protected speech and that the use of the internet is a vehicle for the freest form of expression possible. And the allowing ISPs free governance is the government giving tacit approval for repression of free speech as demonstrated by the actions of numerous ISPs. "

The script would basically just make the page look like it's loading really slowly and make the images super low resolution somehow and break other things; then after a few seconds a modal would pop saying \"This is what the internet would look like without net neutrality... Tell the FCC that you support net neutrality\".\n\nThe idea is that a ton of individual website owners would be able to just pop this script on their site to \"opt-in\" to a massive blackout of the web on a specific day. If they ever wanted to \"opt-out\" (say after we've won the internet back, or if they are concerned that it would go down on important days) they would just need to remove the call to this script.\n\nDoes anyone know if this already exists? If not, is anyone interested in co-developing it with me?\n\n*Edit:* I just set up a blank repo on github for the project.... hopefully I'll find some time soon to get started.

The American people are not people to them; we are cash flow sources, nothing more.  The only thing that will be understood by the corporations who spent money to kill net neutrality is to lose profits.  Their shareholders must start receiving negative returns that correlate directly to the end of net neutrality.  \n\nTo that end, boycotting them might have an impact, but that's just not possible these days.  The internet is as essential to modern life as the telephone was fifty years ago.  It's something that is a requirement for far too many essential services.\n\nThere is no other effective method left to us to impact their profits than physically harming their infrastructure.  Cities and states need to veto their monopolies, and build taxpayer-funded and taxpayer-owned networks that physically push the corporations' wires off the poles.\n\nConsidering the general consensus among the people in my city, it would not shock me if my area began seeing quite a few magically severed fiber optic cables in the coming months because of this.  While I don't personally condone vandalism, I understand this sentiment completely.  Comcast and Verizon will have to hire maintenance crews to replace their expensive cables, only to have to do it again a week later.  And again.  And again.  If even ten cities do the same, it could mean tens of millions of dollars worth of lost profits.\n\nAgain, *I do not condone completely justified vandalism*.  I'm just saying that it's the eventuality to which people are being driven."

            "text": "Let me share my thoughts with you on how to win this fight this time around.\n\nThe entire game is about where the Republican party wants to be on all of this in the next 3 to 4 months. They were all opposed to Title II reclassification, but that does not mean they are all uniformly in favor of Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon ripping everyone off. However, they can't get over their ideological desire to reverse anything that has to do with President Obama.\n\nThat being said, all of this is going to come down to what I call \"brute force politics.\" Meaning, everything that was listed above (call your two Senators and Member of the House, donate, write your comment to the FCC) are ESSENTIAL first steps. \n\nThe next big step is to go even further and ask for a meeting at the local district office to explain why NN is important you. You should also get your friends who agree with you to come as well. You should also try to make it to one of their town halls (provided they are still holding them, some have cancelled because they are tired of being yelled at). Bodies and numbers and a real persistent and unbearable show of force on the ground as voters back home is how we are going to win this (brute force politics). \n\nNo one is immune to the political process, and if a sufficient number of Republicans feel the pressure back home, they will have to seek their escape hatch which will likely come in the form of asking the FCC not to proceed. If just ONE Republican Senator sent a letter to the FCC telling Chairman Pai, don't move forward, for whatever reason (think of a new plan, let us legislate instead, or I'm ok with Title II in the mean time etc), that will start the dominoes. \n\nThe Democrats are pretty much all in the right place on this after the broadband privacy repeal. They know the Republicans screwed themselves by doing the cable and telephone industry a blatant favor like that and have no incentive to let them off the hook. They'll run on Internet freedom coupled with being pro-privacy right over them in 2018. It is on the Republican majority to decide how they want to get out of the head lights on this one (but it is on all of us to make sure they understand that we are the headlights).\n\nThe MAIN challenge I am seeing is the purposeful attempt by Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon as well as Chairman Pai to make their plans out to be something completely different. For example, his proposal is called \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" when in fact it is destroying it. The big cable and telephone guys are advertising like mad that they support network  neutrality despite the fact that they sued the government several times to block network neutrality. \n\nI have no doubt they will try to bamboozle right leaning voters into thinking this is about Obama and government regulation as opposed to what it is really about, enhancing the power of Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon.\n\nSo everything in the post here is super good and useful as your initial fighting tools, but the extra steps are how we convert this into a third rail issue. \n\nYou want to know why this fight keeps coming up? It is because a lot of the politicians who have been terrible on these issues keep getting re-elected because people are willing to prioritize other social division issues or taxes etc before having this as a litmus test for voting. The moment the Republicans feel like this is a loser for them (conversely the Democrats feeling like this is a winner for them), the sooner we will get to final victory.\n\nBut make no mistake, we have the biggest fight ahead of us with Chairman Pai and this proposal. Now, we got 60 to 90 days to have maximum impact, so lets make it happen (especially if you are represented by a Republican Senator or Member of the House)."

Part of the Administrative Procedure Act states that agencies may not make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious.\n\n> If a court were to find an agency action arbitrary & capricious (like, say, reversing a legitimate action after just 2 years with absolutely no change in circumstances or data to support said reversal), then a federal court may reverse that action.\n\n> This is in place to prevent exactly this type of situation and to ensure some measure of stability and continuity in agency rules from one administration to the next. There needs to be an actual reason to change the rules other than \"fuck that other President.\" I actually feel fairly confident that this will be struck down in court.\n\n> [Here](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/guides/stand_of_review/IV_Review_AD.pdf) is a nifty little primer on this standard of review for anyone who's interested."

Be a person in power that decides what is enacted\n\nOr\n\n2. Influence a person in power that decides what is enacted.\n\n\nIn this case there is not time to take the first path so we must go with the second. There are many ways to do this, e.g., money, connections, etc., but for the general populace we have one primary recourse.\n\nWe must make it cost those deciding policy, to go against the people\u2019s will. If whatever form of resistance, or lack thereof, you choose does not do this or further enable this then it is basically pointless.\n\n\nIf you ask, \u201c*how* do we make it cost them something?\u201d the answer is simple.\n\n1. *Be disruptive* to the decision-makers, or anyone that can influence them, and make it known why they are being disrupted. (Direct disruption will provide direct incentive to follow the people\u2019s will, while indirect disruption will apply pressure from those that can influence them to follow the people\u2019s will so that they will stop being disrupted.)\n\n - This means direct action that will hit the pocketbook\u2019s, reputation\u2019s, convenience, and lifestyle\u2019s of these power players and those that wield influence over them.\n\n2.

Better to have a maintained smaller contingent of people providing continuous disruption.\n\n2nd Corollary: If people allow their disruption to be controlled, following the dictates of the powerful, it is no longer disruptive, and again approaches pointlessness.\n\n\nFor those unwilling to take direct action, there is still much you can do to further your cause.\n\n1. People (friends, family, coworkers, denizens of the Internet) must be educated about the issue, why it is important, and how they can help achieve the desired result.\n\n2. People can help plan to determine the most disruptive (effective) actions, their timings and locations, and reach out to actively organize others and provide them logistical support to execute those plans.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. No matter how many books you read or how much history you analyze, you will find variations of the above. I can only hope that, now being informed, there will be those that choose to fight for their agenda instead of giving up, believing themselves powerless.\n"

I've seen it even posted it in this thread, the biggest issue is with Americans having only one choice for their area in many places. You may not have any issue with your connection now. What happens when you do?\n\nI'm Canadian, however many of my American friends who have had issue with their internet describe it as 'pulling teeth' trying to get it serviced or even looked at for that matter. If I have an issue and my ISP gives me grief, I have 3-4 alternative viable ISPs that I can switch to. Companies here practically bend over backwards trying to keep customers (then end up gouging them anyways).\n\nCanadian ISPs have their own problems - but for Americans; IMO the biggest issue is this 'gerrymandering' collusion bullshit that somehow came up where you only have one legitimate choice while a few streets down, they only have one choice of a completely different provider. So if you have a problem with your provider, it's a fight to get anything done because where else are you going to go? Smaller providers can't even start up because they get bought out immediately or the barrier to entry is so high that it's nearly impossible to get anywhere so you get this monopolistic bullshit.\n\nAnd somehow the companies have made Net Neutrality the big focus - it wouldn't even be needed if this collusion went away.

Since most users lack the technical expertise to realize these signs, check battery stats, then replace the battery it's a reasonable thing to do from a user experience standpoint.\n\nAs much as I'd like to paint Apple as evil, because I'm probably a bit biased towards Android and hate Apple's business practices, this isn't as bad as people are making it out to be.  Now that I've actually started reading up on what they're doing and why it makes sense.  It really will prolong the life of the device once it starts to fail."

The fact that some super rich financial entities decided to do that, by itself, probably generally drives down the value of the stock because people start thinking \"oh shit, giant fund X thinks this stock is gonna tank, it's probably gonna tank!\" then people sell their shares to get away from that stock and because the stock market is at least partly mass psychology/mass delusion it becomes self-fulfilling prophecy. The giant fund casts doubt on the stock and short sells it, the doubt makes the stock actually go down, the giant fund wins their shorts.\n\nBut this time a bunch of redditors with some money said \"okay, no, I think gamestop is a fine stock, I'll take the other end of that bet\", and the fact that they all bought gamestop propped up the stock price, causing the giant rich funds to lose their short bets.\n\nBecause of the audacity of a bunch of regular retail investors daring to take on and beat a giant elite hedge fund, they're treated like some sort of financial terrorists. They represent a threat to the financial industry, which often works by having super rich funds manipulate the market to get richer. Having a bunch of regular people interfere with the work of the elite financial class poses a threat to the games they play, and so they've got the entire financial industry, and their lapdogs in the media, and potentially their (captured) regulatory agencies to crack down on this new threat."

            "text": ">The inexplicable rise in AMC and GameStop shares  \n  \nIt's explained, very easily, and without much digging.  Both stocks were targeted by hedge fund short sellers so greedy they left themselves vulnerable to a short squeeze. Smart intellectuals at /r/wallstreetbets (the smarter-est) saw this vulnerability and memed and hyped redditors into buying and holding GME and AMC so hard that that the shorts will be squeeze to bankruptcy.  \n  \nThen, this week, the shorts doubled down on it!  They took loans from another hedge fund to cover the shorts!  That was when gamestop was near 100.  Now gamestop is at 350 (meaning the shorts just lost another 200% of the money so far), and a new massive squeeze just over the horizon.  On Friday, all the options become due.  And given the current price of the stock, millions the options are \"in the money\" where normally they would be worthless. Which triggers forced buying of shares to from everyone who was shorting the stock through options.  How much?  I think something like 20% of the total available gamestop shares are required to cover it.  And the buying by WSB (wallstreetbets) ate up almost all the available shares to buy.  Which means they *might* have to buy stock at 3x, 4x, 10x? times the current price.   \n  \nI'm expecting fireworks and this to be the short squeeze super nova of the century.  I got me popcorn, and going to watch a multi billion dollar hedge fund go under."

            "text": "From the article: Blink-182 fans are furious at Ticketmaster, the band, and society in general over the astronomical ticket prices to the band\u2019s reunion tour\u2014Billboard has cited ticket prices as high as $600 in some cities. This is, unfortunately, the logical outcome of the entertainment monopoly Ticketmaster has built since it merged with Live Nation, creating a live events behemoth in which a huge portion of ticketing, venues, and the artists themselves are owned or controlled by a single company. \n\nIt is arguably also the case that, in trying to \u201cfight\u201d ticket brokers (called \u201cscalpers\u201d by many), Ticketmaster has done something that is very lucrative for itself and for artists, but also worse for the average fan: It has simply jacked up ticket prices for certain high-profile events to a level where all tickets are more-or-less priced at the maximum level that the secondary market would normally bear. More on this in a minute.\n\nTo understand how we got here, it\u2019s useful to go back to 2009, when Bruce Springsteen wrote an open letter apologizing to his fans for the experience they had trying to buy his tickets on Ticketmaster. At the time, his tickets had gone on sale, sold out almost instantly, and Ticketmaster began automatically redirecting fans to a ticket resale site called TicketsNow, which Ticketmaster also owned. Fans were confused, thinking they were still buying \u201cface value\u201d tickets from Ticketmaster, only now the prices for the best tickets\u2014with a face value that maxed out at $98 in New Jersey, for example\u2014were selling for hundreds of dollars."

ClearChannel then started pushing the same songs, artists and playlists on the whole country, including Blink 182. \n\nBlink 182s success is, in large part, thanks to monopoly power."

It's better for those prices to be captured for the band than line the pockets of scalpers. Sure if you could artificially sell tickets below the price people are willing to pay and somehow exclude scalpers, sure, and that would help provide some access to people, but ultimately the same number of people get to see the show, and the band/venue/etc. makes far less money for it.\n\nLike, it sucks for most of us, but yeah, that's what happens when there's lots of demand for something with a limited supply: high prices.\n\nAs pointed out, the effective solution here if an act wants to keep prices down is to increase the supply of tickets, which is better for fans anyway, since it provides more opportunities for their schedules to line up and give them the opportunity to go see a band they love."

The ~~exuberant~~ exorbitant price was bait to make the actual price more acceptable.  \n  \nIf they initially announced the better price the community would be against any sort of pricing and demand it be free forever, but this way they can sneak in a pricing model\n  \n*puts down tin foil hat*"

Of all the \"reddit better change X or we'll stop using it\" protests, this is by far the most likely to succeed because it's not based on ideological opposition to any individual staff/admin, or moral support for mods. It materially affects me, the end-user.\n\nIf a reddit admin has questionable morals, the way I use the site doesn't actually change. If reddit's mod tools suck, the way I use the site doesnt actually change (unless/until moderation quality goes down, but even then its an indirect effect). But as someone who's been using a third party app forever, tried the official app and given up on it, shutting down third party apps means I'll pretty much not be able to use the site.\n\nWhen yelp made it hard to view reviews without downloading their app, I didn't download their app, I just stopped using yelp. When TripAdvisor did the same, I didn't download the app, I just stopped posting reviews.\n\nFor me, this isn't a \"change X or I'll protest by voluntarily stopping my use of reddit\". It's \"change X or I will have no good way of using the site\".\n\nI'm sure reddit has stats showing that folks like me are in the minority and they can afford to lose me, so I'm just waiting for the day my Sync for Reddit app stops working. It's already getting exhausting trying to figure out if that post was stealth marketing or if that comment was posted by a bot.\n\nEDIT: I guess sarcasm doesn't come through in text... Yes I know narwhal was more cringe than cool, it was just an expression of my time on this site. For other interesting artefacts of reddit history (some actually funny, some even \"cooler\" than narwhals), see: swamps of dagobah, jolly rancher, 2 broken arms, cumbox, unidan, reddit turning Spanish, jumper cables, ducks, carbon monoxide, Boston marathon bomber ... Not necessarily in that order."

Setting a subreddit to private, aka \u201cgoing dark,\u201d will mean that the communities taking part will be inaccessible by the wider public while the planned 48-hour protest is taking place.\n\nAs a Reddit post about the protest, that\u2019s since been cross-posted to several participating subreddits, explains:\n\nOn June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren\u2019t able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn\u2019t something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nA complete list of the hundreds of communities taking part (known in Reddit parlance as \u201csubreddits\u201d) includes dozens with over a million subscribers each."

I work in a head office, we found out about the union thing from the news, it wasn't something we discussed or were concerned with, it was a couple people in a huge global company. The international Lush issues are separate from Lush North America until this year, so on top of that people are confusing the two Marks. Retail has issues with wages in the states, Canadian retail are doing well and pay well above minimum wage, the factories and the office workers are compensated well. When I was packing boxes on an assembly line I was getting 30% of my monthly wage as a bonus. We are treated really well. Like the emotional support I've had chokes me up as I was homeless when I started with them and they hire and train from within so I was able to climb the ranks. Not a lot of companies do that. Hell, they have a fund for people who need to transition. We get free therapy. \n\nMy comment will be buried but in case anyone goes digging, there's a lot of straight up confusion and misinformation due to there being multiple Lush companies and factories around the world as well as a huge divide between the retail and production side of things. Take it all with a grain of salt."

If people just walked away for whatever reason... These \"platforms with massive control over us\" would just stop existing.\n\nObviously this has been said before, but I think users, especially advertisers and commercial users, are sleepwalking into an assumption they need these platforms. I feel like there's very little proof they actually help sell stuff or bring return on investment. The house always wins. Why would these platforms actually help brands? They don't care.\n\nAnd if they do, the CEO is making the right call that it's a worthy trade-off to lose business that comes at such a psychological cost.\n\nThink for yourself and be part of the solution by being off those platforms. The more people leave the platforms, the less problem their domination would be.\n\nIf people stay on them then we definitely need regulation. If people leave that is a totally separate avenue we can take today without waiting for government to get its act together.\n\nI mean both is good. I'm not holding my breath though."

It was a little rough at first but 10x better now. \n\nDon't forget the business lush is in. Not politics but straight sales and product. A cosmetic company, all money aside...give me a fuckin break with this level of \"business\". Stop giving your money to shit companies."

When a super majority of america dont evne know we have a facebook issue.  Its like every once in a while someone announces they will no longer ever shop at walmart. Feel good stories for sure, but they dont actually accomplish much. Not to discourage, go for it, just historically when things get this big it takes too many of us to all agree and participate. and well as you can see even when it directly effects people, like employees at amazon, we have trouble even organizing unions"

I've hit up all my rep's, signed all these petitions, I'm spreading the word, but it appears as though the FCC doesn't care, and congress isn't going to replace the members of the FCC before the vote. It appears to me that net neutrality will not last that much longer.\n\nMy question is what the hell are we going to do after net neutrality is repealed? Will we storm the streets? Will we just cry over the (probably censored) internet? It seems to me that for the government to realize we actually care about an issue, we gotta make our voices heard. Not saying that will work with the current administration, but what else can we really do as just another of 321 mil people in this country?"

He understands you can't do this, but also correctly notes that very specific information can be parsed from aggregate data. His company is matching donations to EFF. They have a huge history of supporting privacy. I'm linking his explanation here because I've listened to Temkin's podcast and genuinely think the guy is cool and smart as shit. He doesn't deserve the bullshit and mis- and dis-information about him (or this bill) in this thread. \n\n\nI tell ya hwat, this bill is voted on by folks with little to no understanding of its implications, but its image and forward facing spin sure are being manipulated by folks who do.\n\n5 years later edit: just found this comment of mine after temkin and the toxic work environment he created and all the problematic stuff.  I take back the smart and cool as shit. But, certainly clever."

If you go to a page that has Facebook comments implemented, Facebook knows you went there even without being logged into their service.  \n\nI'm posting this simply so people will know the only effect of this legislation is Comcast, Verizon, Cox, AT&T and other ISPs will not be required to create an opt-in page to continue sharing your personal data.  \n\nIf they discounted your bill to get you to opt-in, that would have been perfectly legal under the new rules.  In fact, AT&T used to charge $29 extra to their customers to opt out of deep packet inspection, or \"Internet Preferences\" as they phrased it.  They ended that program in 2016, right before the legislation which was just repealed was passed, as they wouldn't have been able to charge you extra for opting out.  My guess is had these laws actually taken effect, AT&T would have instead given you a $29 credit on your bill for opting in...\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/att-to-end-targeted-ads-program-give-all-users-lowest-available-price/\n"

Forgive me if someone did say this towards the top I don't have time to read too deeply in this thread right now\n\nThe only info you'll be able to see is a list of users(identified by only a number, effectively)and the websites each one visited. Possibly timestamps too but hopefully not, if so then that will be a loophole in the 'attempt' to avoid making individuals histories identifiable.\n\nyou could get an aggregate of the data, to be 100% accurate you'd need ALL the data from the ISP of the person your looking for, and find out a few specific websites visited by the person at exactly what time, and with a simple script and a lot of computing time you could identify all users who visited websites 1 through n at exactly the same time as that person. Keep adding datapoints or filtering with whatever you can think of until you're down to one person. If you don't have timestamps it'll be much more difficult but still doable with more data points with more of them being less popular sites with a lower number of visitors and more varied data points that don't correlate with the other ones(people visiting multiple websites on an obscure/unpopular anime site + a website for a specific and unpopular fantasy football website + a bunch of visits to a very exclusive political forum would get you down to a pretty low number, even without timestamps)."

Through all the tough political times in the U.S., my parents have always told me that the beauty of America is not that it's perfect, but that you can still fight for the change you want. They've tried to explain what the Soviet Union was like, but it's tough for an American like myself to really understand the culture and life there. The idea that the government, which is really one person no matter what it looks like, can and will do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, and everybody knows it. You can't dissent, can't protest...there is no group to protest to, it's one guy who doesn't give a shit. \n\nAnyhow, for years they've been telling me that the west has no idea what they're dealing with in Putin. And as difficult as this is right now my father is a convinced this act will be Putin's undoing. It will unite the west as never before and also send his own people over the edge. It's easy to go along in Russia when your assets are still yours, but every person there with any wealth or power has assets in the west. If that gets taken away Putin's influence will be shaky. People are typically easy to understand, they are selfish and look to protect and provide for themselves and their families first. Take away their assets and they won't give two shits about the Soviet empire Putin is trying to bring back.\n\nI hope my dad's right."

The Government usually doesn't do things to benefit the people they do things to benefit them and take away rights during events like this. Much like 9/11 and the Patriot Act. Even if you didn't agree with the \"Patriots\" . I would encourage you to be pro privacy and against any intrusive laws that come outta. Our rights get slowly and slowly taken away from us maybe not as drastic as China or Russia but you can damn well guarantee the powers that be would like to do it . So their chipping away and will use events like this as excuses. The Patriot Act and the Snowden Revelations where a perfect example. Also invite you to watch this TedTalk of a man who talks about how the US commits atrocities all around the world for the gain of the elite or corportions keep your eyes open for the Obama era to come back in and more armed conflict at our young man and woman. I personally didn't care for Trump but do like the fact he didn't want us to get into more armed conflics overseas . I was told he was tryna pull the troops outta war zones but he has people blocking him and this was coming from someone who works for the JSOC . Gotta excuse me for the ranting all this kinda came out but it's definitely a concern we should all worry about if you like your rights or privacy.\n\nEncourage y'all to watch John Perkins other YT videos as well. They opened my eyes even more https://youtu.be/btF6nKHo2i0"

Look at the language used, and the heavy handed responses in social media.  And now gofundme.\n\nBut while the fires, vandalism, assaults, and looting  over months in many cities including storming of the Whitehouse has been described as \"mostly peaceful\".\n\nNo condemnation from Democrats of the violence and destruction targeting our government and in particular this (at best chaotic, at worst read the headlines) administration.\n\nIf you are on the left or right...\n\nBe worried.

We would always choose someone that skirted job responsibility the most and/or missed the most days the previous week; it was a complete goof on the whole process. We would always make sure to use those corporate catch phrases like \"*above and beyond*\", \"*lend a helping hand*\", \"*a team player*\", \"*outside the box*\", \"*stepped up to the plate*\", \"*sacrificed for the greater good*\", or whatever other word vomit we came up with. It was our way of pointing out corporate nonsense but since it was corporate that approved the submissions and not the local office, they never caught on...\n\nThese appeared on our intranet site. No prize, no special recognition other than the post itself.  Complete crap."

I find it interesting that when right-wing talking points are banned from Twitter, I read a comment section here explaining that 'people don't understand that freedom of speech relates to the *government* restricting speech, not private companies' as if that makes everything OK.  \n\nPerhaps Amazon is giving us an example of why it might be a nice idea if the companies that control *huge* parts of our lives had to reflect the values of our society.  What Amazon is doing here is most likely totally legal.  It's their own APP, their own servers, their own choice what may be discussed.  This is the *precise* defense used by people who are happy to see restrictions on speech that they don't like on Reddit and Twitter.  Well the boot is on the other foot now and hopefully we can agree that this behaviour is unacceptable."

All I can read is the freaking NBC page.\n\nRep: Yes, ma\u2019am. We\u2019re sorry to hear you are having difficulty and are happy to help you with this matter. Please wait while I access your account.\n\n\u2026\nRep: Ma\u2019am, it looks like you only have the basic Internet Services package.\n\nMe: Yeah, same one as last year.\n\nRep: Ma\u2019am, in 2018, we are pleased to tell you we have actually improved our packages to better fit our customer\u2019s needs. Your Basic Services Package covers your local news station and Comcast-approved affiliated websites only. If you wish to access more websites, you will need to upgrade your package to the Social Media, Streaming, or News Packages. If you want all three categories, you will need to upgrade to a VIP package. If you want access to more than 5 categories you will need to upgrade to the All Access Package.\n\nMe: Uh, what?? Why? What do those cost? I want the service I had last year, I didn\u2019t agree to any changes!\n\nRep: I understand ma\u2019am. Your current Basic Services Package is the same price as last year at $79.99/month, each additional package is $9.99/month for unlimited access to the approved category. VIP Packages are an additional $49.99/month and each All Access Package is an additional $129.99/month.\n\nMe: Are you @$*#&$ kidding me? If I want the same service as last year, I have to pay $210/month?!\nRep: Yes, ma\u2019am. And its unlimited access, so it really pays for itself the more time you spend on it.\n\nMe: Uh, no\u2026Why is there a change? I refuse to pay more for the same service. Isn\u2019t it illegal to filter access to websites?\n\nRep: Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m pleased to tell you that in December 2017, Ajit Pai and the FCC decided to revoke Net Neutrality rules, allowing us at Comcast to better serve you with these customized packages. If you didn\u2019t want this, you should have called your local government representative @ https://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ or submitted complaints to the FCC @ https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact. Have a nice day!\nThis is a future situation I\u2019m afraid could happen if Net Neutrality rules are revoked this December. \n"

As in a central piece of their platform, not just token lip service.\n\nCorruption is rapidly becoming the primary threat to the long term health of our democracy.\n\nWe need to fix our constitution to blunt the outsized power of money in our government.  But to do that, we need to have a majority of representatives in office who are committed to resisting and fixing the influence of money.  \n\nUltimately, we as a society need to become committed to corruption reform as a central political value of America and as part of our very identity as Americans.\n\nVigilance against corruption must become a prime value for every American citizen (right alongside liberty, opportunity, and fundamental rights) because while the need to put down corruption is especially vital today, it is a struggle that we will always face.\n\nIt's time for We The People to get fed up and \"drain the swamp\" ourselves.  Get out there and vote.  Vote first against corruption.  Forget party lines if you have to.  Once we get ammendments that blunt the impact of big money built into the Constitution, and Congress begins listening to the people again, then we can go back to worrying about our party line concerns and get all the practical problems fixed too.  Then we will be able to leave to our children and grandchildren a nation that we are proud of, one that will look after them properly.\n\nTake up your voting powers and vote out the corruption.\n\n"

She was adamant about getting an Airbnb rather than a hotel.

They claimed there was a handycap ramp into the entrance but when we got there it was about half the width of a sidewalk and not big enough for a wheel chair, basically a large curb. The \"A/C\" was a fan and the most egregious part was that the \"queen bed\" was a foam topper on a Full boxspring/frame. NOT EVEN A FUCKING MATTRESS. There were a ton of other issues but we basically checked in after a long day of travel and immediately requested a refund and went to hotel chain nearby. infinitely better experience but they also had a hospital rate. in the end they still charged us the cleaning and cancellation fee which was MORE THAN 4 of the 7 days at the hotel. airbnb is an absolute scam fuck them"

That can be found on CNN's documentary series \"The 70s\", in the episode, \"Television Gets Real.\"\n\nThe second is where I miss matched my information. The early 80s is when Sony had a court case with Universal in which Universal wanted to claim recording home television was copyright infringement.\nYou can take a guess which side lobbied the FCC to support it.\nThankfully Sony won, in an admittedly close Supreme Court case.

GJ please see your way to the door, someone with verizon will give you your check."

It follows that only ~~the federal government~~ ICANN can set regulatory policy in this area.

Thus it would fall under the Commerce Clause and thereby the Supremacy Clause.\n\nSo strictly from a legal point of view, I can see his point, and it would be a really good one to make in court. California would need to prove that they can divide the Californian Internet from the rest of the American Internet without harming the wider American Internet. That's difficult, and I don't know about the idea of having the entire Internet being divided up in regulation between the states--it sounds very much not the \"open and free Internet.\"\n\nSo, whatever you think of Pai or Net Neutrality, California is not the answer here. Get Net Neutrality implemented or repealed either in Congress or the FCC or don't do it at all."

            "text": "So many people are ignorant on this subject. The most common argument I'm seeing is\n\n*\"Well I haven't seen any changes yet so what are we worrying about?\"*\n\nThe foolishness of that sentiment is pretty obvious, but let's assess it anyway. **THE RULES CHANGED**. That's what changed. And if you think for a nanosecond that corporations won't take advantage of that to increase their profits, you are potently ignorant. The obvious retort being\n\n*\"Well, they haven't, so why not?\"*\n\nProbably because the regulations are in a state of fluctuation. ISPs know NN has public support, and if Dems assume control it will be reinstated. It's not profitable for them to restructure their system, both technically and financially, if NN will be reinstated soon. They're waiting to see what happens. And if they do feel safe that NN will remain repealed indefinitely, it still won't happen fast, because they'll want to avoid consumer backlash, even though many ISPs have a monopoly in the region they serve.\n\nAnd for anyone still confused as to whether NN is good or bad, simply Google \"Pros And Cons Of Net Neutrality\". That way you can get info for both arguments and clearly see that the pros of having NN vastly outweigh the cons.\n\nAnd [here](https://www.freepress.net/our-response/expert-analysis/explainers/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history) is a link detailing some examples of corporations taking advantage of customers before Net Neutrality rules prevented them from doing so, just to give you an idea of what corporations will do without NN rules in place.\n\nNN helps you. If you are against it, you are against your own best interests, unless you happen to be high up the corporate ladder at an ISP or telecom company."

            "text": "I think people have a big misunderstanding on how the Internet is setup in the US and what the Open Internet Rules enacted in 2015 did. Quite frankly, Ajit Pai understands these aspects very well.\n\nNow people may have a problem with a municipal ISP like Comcast and think there is a monopoly. But a company like Comcast needs to partner with dozens of ISPs in order for them to offer a service better than the alternatives. They usually do this by connecting to an IXP. The IXP is incentivized to prevent ISPs connecting to it from blocking/throttling traffic. The ISPs are incentivized to connect to an IXP because it significantly reduces latency.\n\nWhat was brought up then was that Comcast was throttling Netflix in order to get them to pay them money for access. However, after the fact it was discovered as a network error by Cogent that Netflix connects to.\n\nIt also would not be in an ISPs best interest to filter traffic. They can somewhat throttle connections based on tiers, but there is a limit without more sophisticated technology. What makes the internet work is simple code working fast and efficiently. The headend processes a packet in a couple lines of code. In order to filter the traffic they would need to run hundreds of lines of code and access a database several times significantly increasing the amount of necessary calculations and making the internet unusable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow what the Open Internet Guidelines did was significantly increase the power of the FCC to regulate and censor the internet. It also added vague rules that would be difficult for a company to comply to. As a result of this Internet Infrastructure Investment was significantly reduced in the years following the implementation.\n\nWhat Pai did by reversing these guidelines is reducing the authority the FCC has to regulate and censor the internet. With current talks on capital hill about social networks doing some type of censoring. I think giving the FCC the power to act on this would have been a major stain on free speech."

It is a crime, under New York law, to steal someone's identity and use it for this (or any other) purpose.  And the identifies of 10s of thousands of New York residents where stolen.  Schneiderman has all the legal standing he needs to pursue this.\n\nJust FYI, it is also a federal crime to represent yourself as somebody else when giving any information to any federal agency, so this was also a federal crime.  Don't look for any feds to follow this up under this administration.\n\nNote that no money has to change hands for it to be a crime.\n\nSince the FCC is not working with the investigators, my guess would be that the Republican FCC commissioners either were directly responsible or they know who was directly responsible.\n\nThey can dodge the feds because the Republicans in charge there are in on the game, but they can't dodge New York charges.

Only 6% were unique.  A ton were \"authored\" by John Oliver, or Net Neutrality, and plenty of the emails, both on the pro and con side, were fake, and plenty of the pro-comments were just tirades against the members of the FCC.\n\nThe comment system is a joke and, honestly, most people have no idea what net neutrality really is. It was bots on one side sending messages in, and mindless people on the other pushing a button that says they support something. I'm glad that their decision mostly ignored these comments, first and foremost because public opinion is a terrible thing upon which to base policy, and second because this whole public opinion comment section is a joke.\n\nAgain, I support net neutrality, but this harping on and on about the comments, which were all round a complete joke, is getting tiresome.

So basically, anything that someone disagrees with can be seen as hate.\n\nIf you subscribe to the idea that only white people can be racist, do you create policies based on what race a person signed up as?  Or make an algorithm to parse speech from different racists before deeming it racist?  That seems problematic.  Is \u201cit\u2019s okay to be white\u201d posts racist?  The argument for that is that it\u2019s exclusionary.  But \u201call lives matter is also racist, even though \u201cblack lives matter\u201d is exclusionary.  It\u2019s an absolute mess of ideology.  We need to agree on the definitions.\n\nJust because the media says something from Trump is racist or glorifies violence doesn\u2019t actually mean that it does.  Especially in the ideologically charged times we live in.\n\nHow do you tell if someone thinks black lives don\u2019t matter compared to criticizing the organization named \u201cblack lives matter\u201d because they aren\u2019t the same thing at all.\n\nThis is such a mess because words need to have real meanings and not abstract subjective meanings colored by peoples experiences and feelings.  \n\nIf you asked people what hate or racism means you\u2019re going to get wildly different answers every time."

The REAL point here is that there is a good chance the use of that photograph was permissible under fair use standards.[EDIT: See comments below about fair use analysis] But because of the way the DMCA works out in practice, Trump never had the opportunity to defend it under that standard, just like the tens of thousands of people who have their YouTube videos taken down under similar circumstances.\n\nIt's not okay when it's an interview on the street with a protester that is taken down because of background music that can be heard playing on the street, and it's also not okay when it's a video by the President. We need to change the DMCA takedown process so that it has a reasonable accommodation for those who contest a claim on the basis of fair use or plain error."

It goes into a deletion process that lasts as much as 60 days (the renewal grace period). During this time the domain wont resolve, but the owner can still renew. So, assuming the .com.ar registry works the same way that would have been a long time where the site would have been down, but Google could have renewed. So not sure how he could have picked it up."

            "text": "Seems like there is a lot of misunderstanding in this thread (or the desire to pile on Google as having made a dumb mistake / being evil is so great as to negate the need for facts).\n\nSome clarification, for those who don't understand how domains work:\n\n1) As per the article's on content (which disagrees with the headline), the domain was not expired (it expires in July of 2021).  This can easily be verified by doing a domain search on nic.ar or icann.org.  The domain record for google.com.ar expires July 8th, 2021, and has been active since June 8th, 1999.  When a domain changes hands, the registration date will change along with it, and when domains are registered, they are registered for at least 1 year at a time, usually longer.  So this domain was not expired when Mr. Kuro\u00f1a \"bought it\".\n\n2) Even if it was expired (which it wasn't), the [rules](https://www.icann.org/udrp/) around cybersquatting are well established at this point.  Effectively, you will lose your rights to a domain if it infringes on someone else's trademark , you have no rights or legitimate use for a domain, or you registered it in bad faith.  Given the usage of the trademark \"Google\" around the world, and the lack of an obvious use for Mr. Kuro\u00f1a (if his last name was Google, he might have had a case), this would have been a clear cut case of cybersquatting anyway, if it had expired (which it didn't).\n\nHow this happened is anyone's guess at this point, but my guess is one of two things:\n\n1) A bug/error on the side of the Argentinian registrar, which allowed some active domains to be purchased and transferred incorrectly.\n\n2) A social engineering attack on the domain by Mr. Kuro\u00f1a.  I have no evidence to support this, but it's a common way for domains to be transferred away from their rightful owner.\n\n**TL;DR:** The domain was not expired, Mr. Kuro\u00f1a should never have been able to register it, and Google is not evil for reclaiming it (if it was ever really taken away from them in the first place)."

This is domain sniping or domain drop catching.\n\nIt annoys me when articles take this tone as if they're trying to educate people about something, and they've fucked it up.\n\nCybersquatting is when you register a domain that matches a well known company or brand, which they haven't registered, with the intention of one day selling it to that company, or catching unsuspecting people who believe it's the official website of that company.\n\nCybersquatting is rare these days, at least high-profile cases are, because major companies tend to already own all the more common domain name versions of their trademark.  It isn't the wild west of the 1990s anymore where you might register, eg, wendys.com because wendy's don't happen to have done so.\n\nYou could make the argument this person registered the domain with the intention of cybersquatting, and  that may be, but the article makes the false claim that registering a name the moment it expires is called cybersquatting."
